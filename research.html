    				Joint kinematics, namely joint angles, are a widely used metric of human performance and health spanning a number of disciplines including human biomechanics, human factors, and ergonomics. Optical (camera-based) motion capture systems are well-suited to providing joint kinematic data at the cost of conducting the data collections in a laboratory setting. On the other hand, inertial (IMU-based) motion capture, allows for studying human movement in natural settings. However, there are a number of unique challenges to deriving joint angles from IMU data. <br>
    				<br>
					The challenge of extracting joint angles from IMU data requires a sequence of estimations that define: 1) the orientation of the IMU frames relative to their independent world frames, 2) the orientation of their independent world frames relative to each other, and 3) the orientation of the IMU frames relative to their respective body segment anatomical frames. This work contributes a measurement theory to correct for the inevitable integration drift error arising in this sequence of estimates without reliance on magnetometer data. <br>

    				<p class="research-title">Automated Measurement System for Warfighter Performance Quantification in Naturalistic Settings</p>
    				<p class="research-desc">
    				Collaborators: <a href="https://me.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/noel-perkins" target="_blank">Noel Perkins</a>, <a href="https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/leia-stirling/" target="_blank">Leia Stirling</a><br>
    				Warfighter performance is difficult to understand,  monitor, and quantify. The associated challenges are largely a result of the diverse, complex tasks that warfighters perform, the inherent variability in human performance, the environments in which warfighters operate, and the limited knowledge of the measures that characterize task-specific success and failure. Additional confounding effects include equipment (e.g., load, bulk, and stiffness), training, and performance degradation (e.g., fatigue). <br>
					<br>
					This project utilizes an array of wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) to evaluate performance across multiple tasks and the effects of body-borne loads on performance in the context of an outdoor obstacle course known as the Load Effects Assessment Program (LEAP). This work addresses a major need of military organizations that frequently employ the LEAP to understand how added loads influence warfighter performance. Importantly, the findings and conclusions drawn from the nontraditional metrics of performance derived from the IMU data would not be possible using timing metrics, which are historically used to evaluate task performance. <br>
