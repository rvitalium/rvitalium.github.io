					The mission of this lab is to quantify, understand, and distinguish human movement via wearable technologies to better interpret performance, health, and behavior with applications in human-robot interaction. This research is necessarily interdisciplinary and draws from the fields of engineering dynamics, signal processing, robotics, biomechanics, controls, and human factors, to name a few. One of the many challenges associate with this type of work is a comprehensive definition or metric for performance cannot be defined; in fact, most applications require a task-specific definition of performance that has both physical and operational meaning to the stakeholders involved. Below are several examples of projects this lab will be pursuing in the near future.
